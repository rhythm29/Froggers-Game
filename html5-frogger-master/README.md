HTML5 Frogger
=============

This is a fork from the final exercise of the Udacity's Object-Oriented Javascript course
from https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

The exercise has been resolved and refactored to use RequireJS, Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
and a proper object orientation.

It can be played online at http://jmiguelsamper.github.io/html5-frogger
